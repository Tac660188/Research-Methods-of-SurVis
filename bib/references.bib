  abstract = {With the advent of technological marvels like global digitization, the prediction of the stock market has entered a technologically advanced era, revamping the old model of trading. With the ceaseless increase in market capitalization, stock trading has become a center of investment for many financial investors. Many analysts and researchers have developed tools and techniques that predict stock price movements and help investors in proper decision-making. Advanced trading models enable researchers to predict the market using non-traditional textual data from social platforms. The application of advanced machine learning approaches such as text data analytics and ensemble methods have greatly increased the prediction accuracies. Meanwhile, the analysis and prediction of stock markets continue to be one of the most challenging research areas due to dynamic, erratic, and chaotic data. This study explains the systematics of machine learning-based approaches for stock market prediction based on the deployment of a generic framework. Findings from the last decade (2011–2021) were critically analyzed, having been retrieved from online digital libraries and databases like ACM digital library and Scopus. Furthermore, an extensive comparative analysis was carried out to identify the direction of significance. The study would be helpful for emerging researchers to understand the basics and advancements of this emerging area, and thus carry-on further research in promising directions.}

  abstract = {Stock market or equity market have a profound impact in today's economy. A rise or fall in the share price has an important role in determining the investor's gain. The existing forecasting methods make use of both linear (AR, MA, ARIMA) and non-linear algorithms (ARCH, GARCH, Neural Networks), but they focus on predicting the stock index movement or price forecasting for a single company using the daily closing price. The proposed method is a model independent approach. Here we are not fitting the data to a specific model, rather we are identifying the latent dynamics existing in the data using deep learning architectures. In this work we use three different deep learning architectures for the price prediction of NSE listed companies and compares their performance. We are applying a sliding window approach for predicting future values on a short term basis. The performance of the models were quantified using percentage error.}

The network itself and the related learning algorithms are reasonably well documented to get an idea how it works. This paper will shed more light into understanding how LSTM-RNNs evolved and why they work impressively well, focusing on the early, ground-breaking publications. We significantly improved documentation and fixed a number of errors and inconsistencies that accumulated in previous publications. To support understanding we as well revised and unified the notation used.}

  abstract = {The stock market is known for its extreme complexity and volatility, and people are always looking for an accurate and effective way to guide stock trading. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are developed by recurrent neural networks (RNN) and have significant application value in many fields. In addition, LSTM avoids long-term dependence issues due to its unique storage unit structure, and it helps predict financial time series. Based on LSTM and an attention mechanism, a wavelet transform is used to denoise historical stock data, extract and train its features, and establish the prediction model of a stock price. We compared the results with the other three models, including the LSTM model, the LSTM model with wavelet denoising and the gated recurrent unit(GRU) neural network model on S&P 500, DJIA, HSI datasets. Results from experiments on the S&P 500 and DJIA datasets show that the coefficient of determination of the attention-based LSTM model is both higher than 0.94, and the mean square error of our model is both lower than 0.05.}

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel application of deep learning models, Paragraph Vector, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to financial time series forecasting. Investors make decisions according to various factors, including consumer price index, price-earnings ratio, and miscellaneous events reported in newspapers. In order to assist their decisions in a timely manner, many automatic ways to analyze those information have been proposed in the last decade. However, many of them used either numerical or textual information, but not both for a single company. In this paper, we propose an approach that converts newspaper articles into their distributed representations via Paragraph Vector and models the temporal effects of past events on opening prices about multiple companies with LSTM. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on real-world data of fifty companies listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange.}

  abstract = {Impact of many factors on the stock prices makes the stock prediction a difficult and highly complicated task. In this paper, machine learning techniques have been applied for the stock price prediction in order to overcome such difficulties. In the implemented work, five models have been developed and their performances are compared in predicting the stock market trends. These models are based on five supervised learning techniques i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Softmax. The experimental results show that Random Forest algorithm performs the best for large datasets and Naive Bayesian Classifier is the best for small datasets. The results also reveal that reduction in the number of technical indicators reduces the accuracies of each algorithm.}

  abstract = {Precise prediction of the stock market is incredibly difficult due to how volatile and non-linear it is. The growth of artificial intelligence and improvements in processing power have increased the accuracy of programmed methods of prediction in predicting stock values. In this paper, we used Multilayer Linear-Regression, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms to analyze the price trends over different time periods to predict the closing price of five companies, operating in different sectors. The final features we used were open, high, low, and close prices (OHLC), which were chosen using data pre-processing techniques. The dataset we used was made up of daily prices from 3 November 2012 to 3 November 2022. The number of previous days that would be required to predict the current day’s closing price is known as the sequence length. Then, using a different set of information, we adjusted this length and evaluated the accuracy. Our models performed the best for a sequence length of 5 and LSTM outperforms other models for each company’s dataset with different sequence lengths.}

  abstract = {In this research paper, attempt has been made to explore the relation especially the causal relation between stock market index i.e. BSE Sensex and three key macro economic variables of Indian economy by using correlation, unit root stationarity tests and Granger causality test. Monthly data has been used from April,1995 to March, 2009 for all the variables, like, BSE Sensex, wholesale price index (WPI), index of industrial production(IIP) and exchange rate(Rs/$). Results showed that the stock market index, the industrial production index, exchange rate, and wholesale price index contained a unit root and were integrated of order one. Granger causality test was then employed. The Granger causality test indicated that IIP is the only variable having bilateral causal relationship with BSE Sensex. WPI is having strong correlation with Sensex but it is having unilateral causality with BSE Sensex. Therefore, it is concluded that, Indian stock market is approaching towards informational efficiency at least with respect to two macroeconomic variables, viz. exchange rate and inflation (WPI).},

  abstract = {This paper provides evidence of a significant exchange rate effect on stock index returns using data from seven selected countries practicing free-floating exchange rate regimes. This research uses parity and asset pricing theories, thus placing it within the monetary-cum-economics framework for international asset pricing. In this study, we apply a system of seemingly unrelated regression to control for unobserved heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. The findings constitute evidence of a statistically significant exchange rate impact on stock index returns across selected countries. These findings can be considered as falling under the arbitrage pricing approach of the international capital asset pricing model of Solnik who also used the parity-theoretical framework on exchange rate determination.}
